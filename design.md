# Game Concept

Game feel similar to incremental games.

Game loop similar to survival crafting games.

Game setting is post-apocalyptic zombie scenario.

A shared world for 1-4 players. Players can either be at home, in the field, or in transit. They gather back at home at the end of an in game day.

In the field is where resources are gathered and dangers faced. It is a grid of tiles, about four by four for a small area, ten by ten for a larger area.
Each tile represents the space of a square city block. They represent locations such as school, hospital, abandoned housing.
